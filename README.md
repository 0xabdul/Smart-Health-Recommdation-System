# Smart-Health-Recommdation-System
A Smart Health Recommendation System is an intelligent web-based application designed to assist users in monitoring their health and receiving personalized medical recommendations based on their symptoms, lifestyle, and body metrics. The system acts as a virtual health assistant that helps users make better health decisions at an early stage, reducing the risk of serious illness.

The system allows users to register and log in securely and enter basic health details such as age, gender, height, weight, and daily habits. Using this data, the application calculates important health indicators like BMI (Body Mass Index) and evaluates the user’s health status.
 
Users can input common symptoms such as fever, cold, cough, headache, stomach pain, or fatigue. Based on the symptoms and stored health data, the system provides smart recommendations , including:

- Possible health conditions (basic prediction)

- Home remedies

- Recommended exercises

- Doctor-prescribed tablets (informational purpose)

- Diet suggestions (low-calorie, high-protein, low-fat foods)

The system also includes health monitoring features such as weight tracking, BMI history, and visual charts to help users understand their health trends over time. An admin dashboard is provided to manage users, view anonymized health data, and improve system recommendations.

By integrating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database storage, and AI-based logic, the Smart Health Recommendation System offers a user-friendly, responsive, and scalable platform suitable for both mobile and desktop devices. This system aims to promote preventive healthcare, reduce unnecessary hospital visits, and increase health awareness among users.
